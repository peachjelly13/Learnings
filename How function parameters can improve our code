- We do this by passing an argument inside the function.
- Pass fnctions instead of hardcoding values
- Please avoid using " " in template literals / strings because it is very much going to include that .
- const welcomeEl = document.getElementById("welcome-el")

// Add the ability to choose the emoji as well!

function greetUser(greeting, name, emoji) {
    welcomeEl.textContent = `${greeting}, ${name} ${emoji}`
}

greetUser("Howdy", "James", "ðŸ”¥")

  This is how passing parameters helps it makes the code more generalized.
