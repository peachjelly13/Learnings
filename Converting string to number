// Challenge:
// The toFixed() method doesn't work anymore. Can you make it work?
// Google the error message if you're unsure about how to do it

const totalPrice = "420.69235632455"
const btn = document.getElementById("buy-btn")
btn.textContent = `Buy â‚¬${ Number(totalPrice.toFixed(2) }`


Here as you can see we have used Number to do the same.
